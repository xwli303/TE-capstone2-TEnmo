# TE-capstone2-TEnmo
This is the second Tech Elevator Capstone project completed with the help of Jaime. The program was developed as a RESTful API and command line application using Java, SQL, 
and Spring Framework.
TEnmo is an online payment service for transferring money ("TEBucks") between friends. It allows the user to register and sign in. Once logged in, the user will be provided with 
a list of users to send or request money from. 
The program also has a feature where user can see their transfer histories and pending requests. 

Some model classes (user, loginDTO) and authentication classes were provided to us in the initial code, we developed the remaining codes.
